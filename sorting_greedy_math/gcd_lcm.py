"""
Problem: Find the GCD and LCM of Two Numbers

Write a function:

def solution(A: int, B: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    pass

that, given two positive integers A and B, returns a tuple (G, L) where:

- G is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of A and B.
- L is the least common multiple (LCM) of A and B.

Example:

solution(15, 20)  # returns (5, 60)
solution(7, 5)    # returns (1, 35)
solution(21, 6)   # returns (3, 42)
solution(13, 13)  # returns (13, 13)

Assumptions:

- A and B are integers within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
- The function should return the correct answer efficiently, even for large values of A and B.
